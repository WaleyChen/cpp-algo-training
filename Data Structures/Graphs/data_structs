comparisons
faster to test if (x, y) is in graph: adjacency matrices
faster to find the degree of a vertex: adjacency list
less memory on small graphs: adjacency list (m + n) vs. (n^2)
less memory on big graphs: adjacency matrices (a small win)
edge insertion of deletion: adjacency lists (m + n) versus (n ^ 2)
better for most problems: adjacency lists

adjacency matrix
- n x n matrix
- M[I, j] = 1 if (i, j) is an edge of G
- fast answers to "is (i, j) in G?"
- rapid updates for edge insertion and deletion
- HOWEVER excessive space for graphs with many vertices and relatively few edges
